XcodeColors is an easy-to-use plugin for Xcode 3 & 4.
This project is designed to enable colorizing debugger console output.

XcodeColor installation instructions for Xcode 4:

1. Compile the XcodeColors target for Release (not Debug).
When you do this, the Xcode plugin is automatically copied to the proper location.
This is done via the install script, run by xcb-install.pl via an Xcode build phase.

2. Quit Xcode.

3. Add the following code to ~/.gdbinit:

define xcodecolors
attach Xcode
p (char)[[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@"~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/XcodeColors.bundle"] load]
detach
end

But what about LLDB? Relax, it also works for LLDB.

4. Launch Xcode

5. Open the Terminal.
Run gdb (Type gdb then hit enter).
You'll get a gdb command prompt.
Run xcodecolors (Type xcodecolors then hit enter).
It should look something like this in the Terminal:

~ $ gdb
(gdb) xcodecolors
Attaching to process ...
Reading symbols for shared libraries ...
.. done
0x00007fff84d242fa in mach_msg_trap ()
$1 = 1 '\001'
(gdb) quit

This step is required only once after Xcode start.

5. You're done!
